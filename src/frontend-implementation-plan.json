      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On both screens (pre-accept and accepted), an ambient background animation is visible and feels romantic (e.g., slowly floating hearts).",
        "The animation does not block clicking/tapping the Yes button or interacting with the page (background elements must not capture pointer events).",

Ensure the layer uses pointer-events: none and sits behind interactive content. Keep it within the existing single-page Valentine flow (no new pages/routing)."

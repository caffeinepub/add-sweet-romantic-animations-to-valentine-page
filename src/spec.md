# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Valentine single-page experience feel sweeter and more romantic with additional animations, smoother transitions, and playful micro-interactions.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a subtle ambient romantic background animation (e.g., floating hearts/particles) that runs on both the question screen and the success screen, without blocking clicks/taps.
- Add a smooth transition when switching from the question UI to the success UI after clicking the Yes button (e.g., fade/scale on the main card/content) with no layout jumps.
- Enhance romantic micro-interactions: add an extra sweet hover/tap effect on the Yes button and add a short playful wiggle/motion cue for the evasive No button while keeping its existing evasive behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** The Valentine page shows a gentle romantic ambient background on both screens, transitions smoothly after pressing Yes, and buttons feel more playful and sweet through subtle interactive animations.

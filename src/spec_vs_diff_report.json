  "summary": "Diff implements a floating-hearts ambient background (with pointer-events disabled) and adds No-button wiggle + evasive movement logic, plus some transition state management; however, due to truncation there isn’t clear evidence that ambient animation and transitions apply correctly on both screens, and the summary indicates edits to an immutable UI path.",

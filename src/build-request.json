      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On both screens (pre-accept and accepted), an ambient background animation is visible and feels romantic (e.g., slowly floating hearts).",
        "The animation does not block clicking/tapping the Yes button or interacting with the page (background elements must not capture pointer events).",
        "The animation performs smoothly on typical mobile/tablet browsers (no obvious stutter during normal interaction)."

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "text": "Add smooth UI transitions to make state changes feel sweeter, including a more polished transition when switching from the question screen to the success screen after clicking the Yes button (e.g., fade/scale transition for the main card/content).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "text": "Add small micro-interactions that reinforce the romantic tone: improve hover/tap feedback on the Yes button (e.g., gentle shimmer/glow or soft bounce) and add a playful motion cue for the evasive No button (e.g., a short wiggle before/while it moves) without changing its evasive behavior.",

        "The Yes button has an additional sweet micro-interaction on hover/tap in addition to the existing scale effect.",
        "The No button still moves away on hover/touch/focus as it currently does, and also includes a short playful motion effect that does not prevent it from moving."
